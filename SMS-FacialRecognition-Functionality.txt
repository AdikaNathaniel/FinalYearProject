SUMMARY OF FACIAL RECOGNITION PAPER

# Summary of "The 'face-api.js' Library for Accurate Face Recognition in Web-Applications and Possible use Cases with Accuracy Metrics"

## Overview
This research paper explores the integration of role-based face login using the `face-api.js` framework in web applications. The study introduces a Face accuracy metrics formula to evaluate recognition correctness while addressing challenges in facial feature extraction and real-time face detection.

## Key Components
- **Library**: face-api.js (JavaScript framework built on TensorFlow.js)
- **Models Used**:
  - SsdMobilenetv1 Model (5.4 MB) - For face detection
  - FaceLandmarkModel (350 KB/80 KB) - Identifies 68 facial landmarks
  - FaceRecognitionModel (6.2 MB) - 99.38% accuracy on LFW benchmark
  - FaceExpressionModel (310 KB) - For sentiment analysis

## Methodology
1. **Face Detection**: Models like SSD Mobilenet v1 or Tiny Face Detector identify facial boundaries
2. **Face Landmark Detection**: Identifies positions of eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, and chin
3. **Face Recognition**: The faceRecognitionNet model performs recognition
4. **Human Sentiment Analysis**: Detects expressions like happiness, neutrality, or anger

## System Architecture
- **Components**: Web Browser (Client), Apache Server, SQLite Database, PHP backend, and face-api.js
- **System Flow**: Browser loads HTML/JS code, requests face labels from PHP, performs real-time face detection, compares to known faces, and redirects on successful match

## Experimental Results
- The system achieved 100% accuracy in face detection tests with five anonymous participants
- Successfully detected multiple faces in video streams and webcam feeds
- Face capture feature activates only when faces are detected
- Expression detection demonstrated high accuracy (over 99%)

## Challenges and Solutions
- Browser cache persistence can cause issues when face samples are removed from the admin panel
- Solution: Clearing image cache to ensure accurate authentication

## Applications
- Face recognition-based login
- Role-based user assignment
- Human sentiment detection
- Dynamic control activation based on face detection
- Potential for attendance systems and dual-factor authentication

The research demonstrates the effectiveness of face-api.js for implementing secure authentication systems and sentiment analysis, contributing valuable insights to AI/ML-driven authentication mechanisms.


METHODOLOGY

# How Your Face is Added to a Pre-trained Model for Authentication

## How It Works

1. **Face Embedding Generation**: 
   - The pre-trained model (specifically the FaceRecognitionModel) converts faces into numerical representations called "face descriptors" or "embeddings"
   - These are essentially vectors of numbers (like a digital fingerprint of your face)
   - The model has already learned how to generate these embeddings from millions of faces during its training

2. **Face Registration Process**:
   - When you register your face, the system:
     1. Captures your face via webcam
     2. Detects your face in the image
     3. Generates your unique face descriptor using the pre-trained model
     4. Stores this descriptor along with your identity label in a database

3. **Authentication Process**:
   - When you try to log in:
     1. The system captures your face via webcam
     2. Generates a new face descriptor
     3. Compares this new descriptor with all stored descriptors
     4. If a match is found (similarity above threshold), you're authenticated

## From the Paper

This is reflected in the paper's implementation:

- The system uses `getAllDesc.php` to fetch known face descriptors
- When a face is detected during login, it runs:
  ```javascript
  // Pseudocode based on the paper
  const faceDescriptor = await faceapi.computeFaceDescriptor(detectedFace);
  const match = findBestMatch(faceDescriptor, knownFaceDescriptors);
  if (match.distance < threshold) {
    // Authenticate user
    setSession(match.label);
    redirect('/dashboard');
  }
  ```

## No Model Retraining Needed

The key insight is that you're not changing the underlying model that converts faces to descriptors. You're just:

1. Using the pre-trained model to generate your face descriptor
2. Storing that descriptor with your identity
3. Comparing new face descriptors against your stored one

This is why these systems can be implemented in browsers - they don't require the computational intensity of retraining deep neural networks.

| **Computer Vision**                 | Using algorithms and models (like those in `face-api.js`) to analyze images and videos (e.g., face detection, facial recognition, landmarks).                                                                    |
| **Machine Learning**                | The models youâ€™re downloading (like `face_recognition_model`) are trained neural networks used for face detection and recognition.                                                                               |
| **Web Development / Full-Stack JS** | Youâ€™re implementing this in a **NestJS backend**, which is a TypeScript server-side framework. The models are being served from `public/`, likely for a frontend (React, Angular, etc.) to access via a browser. |
| **Edge AI / Browser ML**            | Since `face-api.js` runs in the browser, the actual face recognition is **client-side**, which is part of a growing trend of running machine learning models on the edge (in-browser, not on a server).          |
